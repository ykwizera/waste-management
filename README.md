Smart Waste Management System
## Project Overview
    This project is developed as a part of the final project for the Enterprise Web Development course. The aim is to create a comprehensive waste management system that enhances waste collection, recycling, and resource management through intelligent technologies.

## Project Theme: Smart Waste Management System

The system will have three primary user roles:

- Household Users: Manage waste collection schedules, track recycling efforts, and view environmental impact metrics.

- Waste Collection Services: Manage routes, schedules, and track performance.

- Administrators: Monitor overall system performance and manage users.

# Guidelines and Requirements
1. Project Setup
- Web Framework: Use Flask or Node.js.
- Database: Utilize SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions with PostgreSQL or MySQL.
 -CI/CD: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like GitHub Actions.
2. Frontend Development
- Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Design: Ensure responsiveness and a modern, user-friendly UI (consider using Bootstrap).
3. Backend Development
-Technologies: Flask or Node.js for backend development.
- API: Implement RESTful API endpoints.
-Database Interactions: Use SQLAlchemy ORM or write SQL.
- Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Deployment: Use Fabric or any tool of your choice for deployment and management tasks.
- Features and Functionalities
- User Registration and Login: Implement user registration and login functionalities using Flask-Login for session management.
- Waste Collection Schedule: Allow household users to schedule waste collection and receive notifications.
Recycling  Tracker: Implement a feature for users to track their recycling efforts and view their environmental impact.
Waste Collection Services Management: Enable waste collection services to manage routes, schedules, and track performance.
Admin Dashboard: Create an admin dashboard for monitoring overall system performance and managing users.
Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures: Use appropriate data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) to handle the application's different aspects.
Algorithms: Implement algorithms for scheduling, route optimization, and data analytics.
Testing
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for critical parts of the application using the Unittest module.
Code Coverage: Ensure high code coverage and reliability.
Continuous Integration and Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests and deploy the application.
Deployment Service: Use a service like Heroku or AWS for deployment.
How to Run the Project
